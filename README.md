# Multi-Agent Optimization in Python (maopy)
#### *Library of distributed convex optimization algorithms implemented in Python using MPI.

## Introduction
Welcome to **_maopy_**, the multi_agent_optimization module. The module contains several distributed optimization algorithms and distributed averaging (consensus) algorithms:
* Subgradient Push (optimization)
* Extra Push (optimization)
* Push DIGing (optimization)
* Push Sum Averaging (consensus)
* Asynchronous Subgradient Push (optimization)

## Examples
Examples (demos) of each algorithm are provided in the main method at the bottom of each respective class. To run any of the demos, depending on your MPI distribution, execute one of the following command line instructions from the directory containing the **_maopy_** module,
```bash
mpirun -np $(num_processes) python -m maopy.$(algorithm_name)
```
or
```bash
mipexec -n $(num_processes) python -m maopy.$(algorithm_name)
```
For example, to run the push-sum consensus demo in the *push_sum_gossip_averaging* file over a 5-agent network (with architecture specified in the demo), one would type
```bash
mipexec -n 5 python -m maopy.push_sum_gossip_averaging
```
Notice that we **did not include the file suffix** ('.py') in the command, since the path is already defined relative to the module.

## Setup
To get started, install the message passing library mpi4py,
```bash
conda install -c anaconda mpi4py
```
Now just clone this repo and you're good to go!

# Enjoy!
